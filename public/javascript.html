            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p>
                I used a dynamic navigation feature called "Box2" on my Home Page. Each navigation item has an image that changes when you hover over it, enhancing the user experience. 
                I implemented this feature using JavaScript concepts like variables, loops, DOM manipulation, and a function called `changeImageOnHover`.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can view the result <a href="index.html">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                I used JavaScript techniques to create a quiz on my homepage, like a Call to Action button. The quiz randomly generates questions stored in an array called `questions`. 
                I modified the webpage using Document Object Model (DOM) methods and used functions to make the start and submit buttons work. 
                The script checks if the user's answer is correct and provides feedback. Loops are used to go through each quiz option.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can see the interactive quiz in action <a href="index.html">here</a>.

        <!-- Map Page Explanation Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Map Page</h2>
            <p>
                I used JavaScript to create an interactive Map Page with clickable "Points of Interest" (POIs) that reveal detailed descriptions when clicked. 
                The script waits for the page to load, then iterates through each POI to attach click listeners. 
                The functionality is designed with user experience in mind, making it easy for visitors to interact with the map and access relevant information.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the future, I plan to enhance the UI by making the POIs transparent and simply indicate interactivity by changing the cursor style upon hover. 
                This will make for a more seamless and intuitive experience for users exploring the map. Explore the interactive map <a href="maps.html">here</a>.

        <!-- History/Timeline Page Explanation Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>History/Timeline Page</h2>
            <p>
                The History/Timeline Page has an interactive feature that shows more information when you click on a specific point on the timeline. 
                The script checks if you're on the right page, stores references to specific parts of the page in variables, adds an event listener to each timeline point, 
                populates a popup with dynamic information when you click on a timeline point, and makes sure the popup only closes when you click on the background. 
                The script uses methods like `querySelectorAll()`, `getAttribute()`, and direct style manipulations to make sure the timeline is responsive and dynamic.

        <!-- People/NPC Page Explanation Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>People/NPC Page</h2>
            <p>
                The JavaScript code for the People/NPC Page uses interactive cards to display information. It works with the DOM using methods like `querySelector()`,
                 `querySelectorAll()`, and `getElementById()`. Loops attach event listeners to each card for the click action, and functions populate the modal with content 
                 from the clicked card's attributes and inner elements. Comparison operators and conditionals are used to ensure that the modal only closes when the modal's background 
                 (but not its content) is clicked. 
                The modal content is updated using methods such as `getAttribute()`, `querySelector()`, and direct style manipulation.
                <br>

<!-- Gallery Page Explanation Section -->
<section>
    <h2>Gallery Page</h2>
    <p>
        To create the Gallery Page, I checked for necessary elements using `getElementById()` and `querySelector()`. I used variables, arrays, functions, comparison statements,
         loops, and conditional statements to implement carousel navigation, grid gallery display, image size toggling, 
        drag functionality, and image navigation direction. I used event listeners for a responsive and fluid user experience, and to handle potential errors.
